                <p>At JRummy Apps Inc. we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) applies to your use of all applications on all platforms (the &ldquo;Application&rdquo; or &ldquo;Applications&rdquo;), the related
                    services we provide (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;) and the Site.</p>
                <p>JRummy Apps Inc. (&ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) has created this Policy to explain our privacy practices so that you will understand what information about you is collected, used and disclosed with respect to the Applications,
                    the Services and the Site. We may update the Privacy Policy in the future, and you will be able to find the most current version of this policy at http://jrummyapps.com/privacy.html</p>
                <p>By using Application, the Services or the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.</p>
                <p>This Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of your information through the Applications, the Services and the Site. It does not cover any collection, use or disclosure by third parties through any applications, Web sites, products
                    or services that we do not control or own, such as Facebook, or any third party features or services made available via an Application, the Services or the Site. All trademarks, trade names, and logos of third parties featured on the
                    Applications or the Site belong to their respective owners.</p>
                <p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
                <p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Information You Provide
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you sign up for a service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address, and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account
                                with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt-out of combining
                                such information.</li>

                    <li>Log Information
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you access or connect to our services, our servers automatically record information that your client sends. These server logs may include information such as your service request, Internet Protocol address, platform or
                                browser type, client version ID, client language, the date and time of your request and session identifiers that may uniquely identify your client.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>User Communications
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, notify you of promotional offers, and improve our services.</li>

                <p>We only process personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
                <p>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising.</p>

                <p>Protecting the rights or property of JRummy Apps Inc. or our users and developing new services.</p>
                <p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services.</p>
                <p>We process personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide
                    our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our service provider partners.</p>
                <p><strong>Choices for Personal Information</strong></p>
                <p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent
                    prior to such use.</p>
                <p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt-out of the use of personal information
                    for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices&nbsp;unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
                <p><strong>Onward Transfer</strong></p>
                <p>We only share personal information with other companies or individuals in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                <p>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
                <p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information
                    based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
                <p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable
                    Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of JRummy Apps
                    Inc., its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
                <p>If JRummy Apps Inc. becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice when personal
                    information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
                <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who installed a particular application on a device. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
                <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
                <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices.</p>
                <p>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and
                    may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong></p>
                <p>We process personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices
                    to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process
                    is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
                <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
                <p>Users have the right, at any time, to know whether their personal data has been stored and can consult us to learn about their contents and origin, to verify their accuracy or to ask for them to be supplemented, cancelled, updated or corrected,
                    or for their transformation into anonymous format or to block any data held in violation of the law, as well as to oppose their treatment for any and all legitimate reasons. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information
                    requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy
                    of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. Requests should be sent to us at the contact information below.</p>
                <p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
                <p>We utilize the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with our privacy statement. We periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely
                    implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect any changes to this Policy to be minor. Regardless, we will post any
                    Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will
